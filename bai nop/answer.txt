1. 

A conceptual object is a discrete set of instances of a domain-specific concept that are manipulated by the modelled system. 

4 instances: 

• An entity is an autonomous and passive object. For example, we can model the Train, Block and Platform objects in our train control system as entities.

• An association is a conceptual object dependent on other objects that it links.  For example, On is an association linking the Train and Block entities; Copy is an association linking the Book and BookCopy entities.

• An agent is an autonomous and active object. For example, a TrainController agent can control the acceleration attribute of Train instances.

• An event is an instantaneous object. For example, an instance of the BookRequest event exists only in a state where a particular patron has made a loan request for a particular book.
